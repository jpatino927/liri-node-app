# liri-node-app
Welcome to my project Liri Bot.

This app will help you search Spotify for songs; Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This app uses "axios package" to retrieve your data request from the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.

If you clone repository to local machine you will need to obtain your own Spotify IP key.

Use the following Commands to request the desired concerts, movie info and song info.

This example will provide you with artists name, song name, preview URL and album:
node sirie spotify-this-song broken wings

This example will provide you with City, Region, Country, and Date of concert:
node sirie concert-this lady gaga

This example will privde you with Title, Year, Rated, Released, Runtime, Genre, Director and Writer of movie requested:
node sirie movie-this kong
